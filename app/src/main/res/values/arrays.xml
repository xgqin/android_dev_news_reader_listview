        <item>We think the tomato is a vegetable, but it is actually a fruit. Because it is not sweet and is used for providing flavour to food, we think of it as a vegetable.
\n\nThe tomato is originally from Mexico. The word “tomato” comes from the Spanish tomate, which in turn comes from the Nahuatl word tomatotl. Spanish explorers who went to South America about 500 years ago, brought back the tomato to Europe. The French called them love apples, while the British called them apples of gold. Young men made necklaces of tomato seeds and presented them to their loved ones.
\n\nThe first people in Europe to eat tomatoes were Italians. As far back as 500 years ago, the joys of eating fried tomato with salt and pepper, was known to them. They discovered that tomato made a very good companion to pasta and cheese dishes.
\n\nIn other countries like England, tomatoes were thought to have poison in them. That is because tomatoes were related to poisonous plants called the belladonna. But people grew them in their gardens because of their attractive colour and look. They even thought that tomatoes caused fatal diseases. But they soon got over their fear of the trait.
\n\nIt is believed that the British brought the tomato to India. This was about 300 years ago. Gradually, the people of Bengal started discovering that the tomato gave a good flavour to their curries. Today, the whole world is crazy about the tomato, whether it is in the form of ketchup, soup or curry flavour.

        <item>“Time to get dressed!” cries a harried Mama as she tries to pack the bag, straighten the tie, pack lunch, tie shoelaces as at the same time she pushes children dragging their heels towards the bus stop. Oh? Is it already “Time for school?” later still its “time for dinner” or “time for bed!” Old Father Time can be quite an interfering busybody and there really is nothing we can do. Most of us spend a greater part of our time and lives trying to beat exactly this – time!
\n\nStrangely enough the clock’s needles seem to take forever to inch forward during a dull lesson, while time really flies when we are having a good time!
\n\nAll of us are time conscious. We surround ourselves with alarm clocks, cuckoo clocks, wristwatches, grandfather clocks and peering at them to make sure we are sticking to our schedule. But have you ever taken a moment to wonder why the needles on the face of a clock move the way they do? Why do the hour and minute needles move from left to right (in what is now called the ‘clockwise direction’) and not vice-versa? No, it is not the whim of the inventor actually there is a scientific explanation for this observation.
\n\nThroughout history, time has been measured by the movement of the Sun (or, more accurately, the motion of the Earth relative to the Sun). The earliest form of timekeeping dates as far back as 3500 B.C. This was the shadow clock or the sundials – a vertical stick or obelisk (A tall, four-sided shaft of stone, usually tapered and monolithic, that rises to a point) that casts a shadow. An example of this clock can be seen at Jantar Mantar in Delhi.
\n\nPeople had already realised that the earth is round and that it revolves around the sun. So for ages people measured time based on the position of the sun – it was noon when the sun was highest in the sky.
\n\nThe earliest clocks were invented in China around 100 A.D. based on these earlier sundials, which were simple devices that marked the movement of the sun with the movement of the earth.
\n\nMechanical clocks were invented in the Northern Hemisphere in the 14th century and the inventors naturally wanted the device to follow the sun’s movement in the sky. In the Northern Hemisphere the Sun appears to move in the sky from the left to the right and so the hands of the clock were made to follow the Sun’s motion, moving from left to right or what is commonly known as clockwise. If you are in the Northern Hemisphere and face the South, you can watch the Sun rising on your left (the East) pass overhead and set in the West (at your right).
\n\nAs simple as that! Come to think of it, if the mechanical clock had been invented in the Southern Hemisphere, the hand on the dial of your watch would have been moving from right to left!
\n\nDo you know there are some Jewish and Arabic clocks that run anti-clockwise? This makes perfect sense as Arabic and Hebrew readers (Arabic and Hebrew characters are written right to left) but baffles everyone else!

        <item>The history of writing instruments with which humans have recorded and conveyed thoughts, feelings and grocery lists, is the history of civilisation itself. This is how we know about our ancestors and their lives.
\n\nThe handy sharpened-stone, used for skinning and killing animals was adapted into the first writing instrument. Around 24,000 BC, the cave man started drawing pictures with the stone onto the walls of his cave dwelling. His drawings showed events in daily life such as the planting of crops or hunting victories. Walls at the Apollo site in Namibia, southwest Africa are believed to be the oldest rock paintings to date.
\n\nBefore paper came along, people used clay or wax tablets on which they wrote using sharp objects such as metal sticks or bones.
\n\nAround 6000 years ago, in 4000 BC, the Egyptians invented the first substance like paper called papyrus. It was a woven mat of reeds, pounded together into a hard, thin sheet. The word ‘paper’ actually comes from the word ‘papyrus’. Ancient Greeks are also known to have used a kind of parchment made from animal skins for the same purpose.
\n\nNow something was needed to write upon the parchment or the papyrus. Bones or metal sticks were no longer useful as the papyrus could not be scratched. So the Egyptians created a reed-pen perfect for the papyrus. These were mostly the hollow tubular-stems of marsh grasses, especially from the bamboo plant. And thus, ancient Egyptians converted bamboo stems into a primitive form of a fountain pen. They cut one end into the form of a pen nib or point. A writing fluid or ink filled the stem and the reed forced the fluid to the nib.
\n\nAnother writing instrument that remained active in history for a long period was the quill pen. Introduced around 1300 years ago in 700 AD, the quill was a pen made from a bird feather. The five outer left wing feathers were plucked from the birds in the spring season. The left wing was chosen because the feathers curved outward and remained away when used by a right-handed writer. Goose feathers were most common, swan feathers were of a high quality, being scarce and most expensive. For making fine line drawings, crow feathers were the best, then came the feathers of the eagle, owl, hawk and turkey.
\n\nQuill pens lasted for only a week before it was necessary to replace them. There were other disadvantages associated with their use, including a lengthy preparation time.
\n\nWhen writers had better inks and paper and handwriting had developed into both an art form and an everyday occurrence, man’s inventive nature once again turned to improving the writing instrument. This led to the development of the modern fountain pen in the 19th century.

        <item>A lush green forest in the middle of a rocky wasteland. No, this paradise is not an illusion. Abdul Kareem has created it with his own hands.
\n\n
Kareem’s 30-acre forest is in Kasargode district, Kerala. It is home to 1,500 medicinal plants, 2,000 varieties of trees, rare birds, animals and insects. Agricultural scientist, MS Swaminathan, has called the forest a “wonderful example of the power harmony with nature.”
\n\nSo, how did Kareem manage to convert a wasteland into a forest?
\n\nLet us go back 24 years, to 1977, when Kareem purchased a five-acre rocky wasteland. Kareem was an airlines ticketing agent with a craze for the woods. Though he never went to college, he could talk about the properties of plants and trees like an expert botanist, reports The Hindustan Times.
\n\nKareem dug a huge well and began to toil in the rocky, arid terrain. In the beginning, people thought he was crazy to waste his time and money on wasteland. But, Kareem has ‘green fingers’ (a term used for people who love nature). Soon, he began investing more and more of his savings to add land and amenities.
\n\nToday, the ‘wasteland’ is the haven of nature-lovers – from students wanting to explore the woods, to agricultural scientists. Kareem has been honoured by several organisations, including the United Nations, for his work.
\n\nHe just let his forest grow naturally, without insecticides or fertilisers. He believed in the ability of nature to replenish itself without the interference of humans. That’s why he does not allow fallen leaves or twigs from the forest to be removed.
\n\nRecently, Kareem even refused an offer by a well-known resort to launch an Ayurveda (ancient Hindu practice of holistic medicine) centre in the forest.
\n\n“I wanted to spread the message that if trees, animals and birds survive, only then human beings have a future,” Kareem said in an interview.
\n\nShouldn’t we be listening?

        <item>Most people all over the world travel by the road. In a city in Italy however, waterways make up the primary commuting routes. The city of Venice, rich in architectural marvels, is best known for its canals. Unfortunately, this beautiful city of flat-bottomed boats (Gondolas), churches and quaint cobbled streets is sinking and sinking fast.
\n\nKnown as the ‘Queen of the Adriatic’, Venice is situated on 120 islands formed by canals in the lagoon between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers, at the northern extremity of the Adriatic Sea. And even the bits of firm ground have rather boggy foundations and all this is slowly getting eroded.
\n\nWhy is Venice sinking?
\n\nThe existing ground water table and the global climate changes that have raised sea levels by several inches, are proving disastrous for the city. As sea-ice melts and water levels rise, floods in Venice are getting from bad to worse. And buildings are already feeling the impact of this phenomenon, with their foundations literally being shaken. Take for example one of the most famous landmarks of Venice, the 900-year-old St. Mark’s Basilica, a famous cathedral that now leans slightly to the left because of its unstable foundation.
\n\nExperts warn that the city may sink an additional eight inches in the next 50 years. Many scared residents have already started to move to drier regions in Italy’s mainland. To tackle the flood menace, a group of Venetians, called the New Venice Consortium, has come up with ‘Project Moses’ – a dam project named after the biblical figure, Moses. The idea is to place underwater gates at different points where the Adriatic Sea water enters the lagoon. When the water is low, the gates will remain open and as the water rises, the gates will close, preventing the seawater from flooding Venice. However, there’s a hitch to implementing this idea. Environmentalists point out that the gates would have to remain closed most of the time and seawater will not be able to move in and out of Venice. As a result, the lagoon water will become stagnant, harming the fish and plants that live there. Until a viable solution is found out, Venice, it seems, would continue to be plagued by floods. Truly, a case of being caught between the devil and the deep sea!

        <item>Martin Luther King Jr. goes down in history as one of the principal leader of the civil rights movement in the United States and a prominent advocate of nonviolent protest. King’s challenges to segregation and racial discrimination helped convince many white Americans to support the cause of civil rights in the United States.
\n\nKing was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and was ordained as a Baptist minister at age 18. He graduated from Morehouse College in 1948 and from Crozer Theological Seminary in 1951. In 1955 he earned a doctoral degree in systematic theology from Boston University. While in Boston, King met Coretta Scott, whom he married in 1953.
\n\nIn 1954 King accepted his first pastorate at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. Montgomery’s black community had long-standing grievances about the mistreatment of blacks on city buses. Heading the year-long bus-boycott against segregation in buses, King soon became a national figure.
\n\nIn 1957 King helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), an organization of black churches and ministers that aimed to challenge racial segregation. King and other SCLC leaders encouraged the use of nonviolent marches, demonstrations, and boycotts to protest discrimination.
\n\nKing and other black leaders organized the 1963 March on Washington, a massive protest in Washington, D.C., for jobs and civil rights. King delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech to an audience of more than 200,000 civil rights supporters. The speech and the march created the political momentum that resulted in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited segregation in public accommodations and discrimination in education and employment. As a result of King’s effective leadership, he was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize for peace.
\n\nThroughout 1966 and 1967 King increasingly turned the focus of his activism to the redistribution of the nation’s economic wealth to overcome entrenched black poverty. In the spring of 1968 he went to Memphis, Tennessee, to support striking black garbage workers. King was assassinated in Memphis on April 4, 1968.

        <item>All of us are very familiar with the mustachioed Little Tramp with the bowler hat and cane _ Charlie Chaplin. But behind this little fellow lurked an extremely creative film maker who scripted, directed and starred in some of the best films of the century.
\n\nCharlie Chaplin was born Charles Spencer Chaplin in London, England on 16 April 1889. His parents Charles Chaplin Sr and Hannah Hill were Music Hall entertainers but separated shortly after Charlie was born, leaving Hannah to provide for her children. In 1896 when Hannah was no longer able to care for her children, Charlie and his brother were admitted to Lambeth Workhouse and later Hanwell School for orphans and destitute children. He made his debut at the age of five in Music Hall when his mother was taken unwell.
\n\nChaplin like his parents became a Music Hall performer, appearing as a clown in Fred Karno’s Mumming Birds Company from 1906. In 1910 he went to the United States and with the Keystone Company in Los Angeles (1914-15) he made films in which his early hardships are reflected in humour and sadness. In Kid Auto Races at Venice (1914), he originated the gentleman tramp routine, twirling cane, bowler, tight jacket, and baggy pants that became his trademark. He also learned to direct his own short films.
\n\nDuring the next four years, Chaplin consolidated his growing international reputation. At the same time he refined his tramp character into a poetic figure that combined comedy and pathos yet retained his meticulously timed acrobatic skills. His films grew in length and subtlety with A Dog’s Life and Shoulder Arms (both 1918). After co-founding United Artists in 1919, Chaplin began independent production in the 1920s of his best feature-length films: A Woman of Paris (1923), The Gold Rush (1925), The Circus (1928), City Lights (1931), Modern Times (1936), and The Great Dictator (1940), his first all-talking film, in which he abandoned the tramp to parody Adolf Hitler. Among his later films only the poignant Limelight (1952) achieved popularity; the apparent cynicism of Monsieur Verdoux (1947) and A King in New York (1957) alienated audiences, while his last effort, A Countess from Hong Kong (1966), left little impression.
\n\nAlthough he was loved and appreciated throughout the world as the inimitable Charlie, Chaplin’s personal life including four marriages, a 1944 paternity suit, and his refusal to accept U.S. citizenship gained him adverse publicity in America. In 1953, accused of Communist sympathies, he was denied re-entry into the country. Thereafter, he settled in Switzerland with his wife, Oona O’Neill and a family of nine children. Initially embittered, he returned in triumph to the United States in 1972 to receive a special achievement award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, followed in 1973 by an Academy Award for his score to Limelight. In 1975, at age 86, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He died on December 25, 1977.

        <item>Satellites orbit the earth because of the force of gravity. To understand why this happens and why the satellite does not get pulled in and fall, we have to understand what forces do. A force will change the motion of an object; it might speed it up, slow it down or change its direction. For example, if you are running and someone pushes you from behind, you speed up (the force is in the direction of your motion). But if someone pushes you in the chest when you are running, you slow down (the force is in the opposite direction to your motion). If you are running and someone pushes you from the side, you move away from them, changing your direction. (the force is at right angles to the motion). This idea is called
\n\n
            Newton’s First Law.
\n\nTo make something move in a circle it must be moving and have a force that is always at right angles to the motion so that it constantly changes direction. This force is called the centripetal force.
\n\nImagine swinging a rock on a string around your head. The tension in the string pulls the rock round in a circle (this is the force at right angles to the motion). So the tension is the centripetal force. If we cut the string, the rock will continue in a straight line because there is no longer a force to change its direction. For a satellite, the centripetal force is the gravitational force, the pull of the earth. If we could switch gravity off, we would lose all our satellites as they move off in straight lines!
\n\nGoing back to the rock example, we need to put energy into keeping the rock moving because the rock is moving through air and is losing energy constantly because of air resistance. We don’t need to do this with satellites because they are moving through space where there is no air, so no air resistance acts on the satellites and they don’t slow down.
\n\nMany people think there is a centrifugal force acting which pulls the satellite (or rock) outwards. This is not the case; there is no such thing as a centrifugal force. Imagine riding in the back seat of a car as it turns the corner. Let us assume the back seat is very slippery and you don’t have a seatbelt on. As the car turns the corner, you slide from the inside to the outside. You could argue that a force is pushing you outwards. In fact the reason you move outwards is that there is no force keeping you moving in the same circle as the car. What you really do is continue in a straight line. Eventually you will hit the far door and the door then pushes you providing the centripetal force to keep you moving in the same circle as the car. If the car door was open you would not have a centripetal force acting and you would continue in a straight line out of the car! (Don’t try this at home!)

        <item>Two boys and two girls. They were to be found at one of the busiest traffic signals in south Delhi. The boys were about five or six years of age. The girls looked older, about eight or nine. As the traffic zipped along on the road, the four of them would play their own games on the divider. As soon as the traffic stopped on one side of the road, obeying the red signal, the children stopped their games. They would then go from car to car with dirty rags. ‘Cleaning’ the windscreens of cars with those dirty rags, they would then ask for some money. Some people would give a coin or two, and many more would tell them to buzz off. As soon as the traffic signal turned green, the children would be off to their little island on the divider, and back to their games.
\n\nIt was difficult to know what they looked like. Their faces were grimy, they wore clothes blackened with time, and their hair was almost matted. But their eyes stood out like precious jewels, they were so bright.
\n\nRanjana saw them daily from her window seat in the school bus. She was 12 years old and brimming with ideas. She was very bright in studies and a member of her school’s athletics team. But her classmates liked her most because she was very kind at heart. Her mother might chase a cockroach with a broom in the house but Ranjana would insist on picking up the insect with a piece of paper and depositing it outside. If the postman trudged up three floors to deliver a letter, she would make sure to give him water on a hot day. The ironing woman’s baby, secure in her mother’s arms, never left Ranjana’s house without biscuits or sweets.
\n\nBut every time the 12-year-old tried to tell her parents to give the children on the traffic crossing some money, they would stop her. “By giving them money you are encouraging them to beg. They will never learn to do anything else,” her mother always said. Ranjana felt very helpless. She kept wondering how they could help the children.
\n\nOne day Ranjana and her brother went for a long walk. They had been so busy licking their icecreams that they had reached the traffic crossing without realising it. The signal was three kilometers from their house. Ranjana decided to talk to the four children at the crossing. She bought them an ice cream each and asked them where their parents were. “Our parents work on a construction site. They have to go to work even if they are ill or they do not get paid,” the tallest girl said. Her name was Kamla.
\n\nThe four children had come from a village in Bihar. Their parents were very poor and had thought they would be able to get better jobs in the city. The children had been going to school in the village but ever since they came to Delhi their education had stopped. “Our parents think it a big help if we manage to collect some money from people at this crossing, the other girl said. Her name was Sitara. The two boys were her brothers. They all lived in a nearby slum.
\n\nSitara said, “Didi, it has been a while since we left school. If we stay on the street for some more time then we will forget we ever went to school. We get used to doing things our own way here. No one tells us what to do.”
\n\nTalking to them Ranjana had not noticed that it had become dark. Her brother told her it was time to head back home. “Bye didi, you are our friend now. No one has talked to us like this before,” Kamla said. Ranjana felt tears prick her eyes. On the way back Ranjana was very silent. Her mind was racing furiously. There must be something they could do to help the children, she thought.
\n\nThe idea came to Ranjana at the breakfast table next morning. Of course her father had a lot to do with it. He worked in a private firm. That morning he was giving instructions on the phone to his junior staff, “Get rid of those old computers. The new ones will be here by tomorrow. Anyway, these computers are useless for us now.”
\n\nSuddenly Ranjana knew what to do. She said, “Daddy, can we take those computers and install them in the community centre run by retired people. You know, the centre to the left of the traffic crossing where those children beg? We can start a sort of a school there. My street children will come because all children are curious about computers. And I have all those kids computer games and the educational software for kids that you got for me long ago. I have outgrown all that and will be happy to donate them to the centre. I will ask my friends to donate kids magazines and children’s educational books. Once we see how interested the children are, we can think of many more things.”
\n\nRanjana’s father looked at her for a long time. Then he went up to her and lifted her off the ground with one bear hug. He said, “I am very proud to have you for my daughter. You may have all of the 12 computers. But you must talk to the people who run the community centre.”
\n\nThe next day was a second Saturday. No school for Ranjana! She went with her mother to the community centre where Mr Kapur was in charge. Mr Kapur was 65 years old and had a bristling white moustache. He heard what Ranjana had to say. Then he said, “Young lady, I have one condition. If we start learning classes for those children, you must give our centre a couple of computers for our official work.” Mr Kapur also said that many of the retired people in the locality would be glad to teach different subjects to the children. Ranjana’s college-going brother said he would be willing to take computer classes.
\n\nThe children at the traffic crossing were overjoyed. Ranjana said she wanted to talk to their parents. They all walked to the construction site – the children, Ranjana, her mother and brother, and Mr Kapur. When the children’s parents realised that there were so many people willing to help them they agreed to the plan. One of them said, “We can’t read or write. And we have not learnt any skill. All our lives we will do this work and struggle to make ends meet. We don’t want our children to suffer the same fate.”
\n\nYou should have seen the bustle at the centre the next day. Mr Kapur’s elderly team was there. Ranjana and her friends staggered to the centre armed with kids magazines and children’s educational books, both in Hindi and English. There was Champak and Chandamama, Balvihar and Twinkle. Colouring books with only some pages coloured, writing books with only some pages written in, and piles of old magazines, from National Geographic and Life to Femina and Outlook. One of Ranjana’s friends had a fat collection of Amar Chitra Katha comics, which she happily sent to the centre. Ranjana’s own collection of Hindi storybooks from National Book Trust and Children’s Book Trust was right on top. She had also brought along her entire set of kids computer games such as her beginner math and reading games CDs which she had long outgrown. Ranjana also gave away the prized kids educational software her aunt had got for her from the US. These were expensive Dorling Kindersley CDs and Ranjana had been wondering what to do with them. Best of all, Ranjana’s brother came with friends who were also willing to teach computers to the children.
\n\nThe school was inaugurated that day. The youngest of the children pressed the button to switch on the computer and everyone looked at Ranjana and clapped. In all there were 12 children in that ‘batch’.
\n\nDo you know what happened to that school, and to the children? They took to the computer like ducks to water. They played all kinds of games on the computer – match the eggs with the right birds; match the vehicles with the right wheels, match the numbers to the objects, put alphabets together to make simple words, add eggs, subtract toffees, and all the games that Ranjana and her friends had gifted to the school. They learnt English very fast because they all wanted to be like Ranjana didi. And before one year was out, a local school was willing to admit them as regular students with scholarships.
\n\nThose children have promised Ranjana that if they see any children begging at that traffic signal, they will haul them off to the community centre. And Ranjana is happy that she never took the easy way out by pressing a coin into an outstretched hand.

        <item>Jules Verne in his science fiction, 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, mentions a ship, Nautilus, which could dive beneath the waves and surface again when it wanted to.
\n\nEven before submarines were thought about, Verne had created the blueprint of this technological marvel. Not only did he describe the machine, but he also explained, in great detail, how it worked. In fact, today’s submarines use exactly the same technology as Verne’s Nautilus did!
\n\nHow does a submarine float and dive under water at will?
\n\nTry a little experiment. Take an empty mug and turn it upside down. Now try and push the mug inside a bucket full of water. You will have to apply a lot of pressure to do so. But once you release the pressure, the mug simply floats back to the top.
\n\nAir is lighter than water
\n\nThe mug resurfaces because the air trapped inside it makes the mug lighter than water. This makes the mug float. Similarly, a submarine has huge tanks called ballast tanks. The air in them allows the submarine to float.

\n\nWhen a submarine has to dive, the ballast tanks are filled with sea water. This makes the submarine heavy and it sinks.
\n\nWhen the submarine has to resurface, the water is pumped out of the ballast tanks and compressed air is forced in. Once the tanks are filled with air, the submarine becomes light again and begins to float.

        <item>We deal with numbers all the time. Not just while doing math lessons at school, but also while counting money at the shop, memorising the numbers of our favourite TV channels or even keeping tabs on the number of hours we spend in front of the Internet! But we are so used to numbers that it has never occurred to us to find out where these numbers come from.
\n\nFor that, we must travel back in time. We must go back to 6th century India. It was around this time, that the great Indian astronomer Aryabhatta invented a set of numerals that is now used by people all over the world.
\n\nYou might already have heard that zero was invented in India. But it is not so widely known that even the other numerals were invented in India only. This is because the figures written as 1, 2, 3 etc. are commonly known as ‘Arabic’.
\n\nThis would naturally make it seem that the number system originated in Arabia and not in India. Sounds rather mysterious no? That something that was invented by an Indian scientist should be known as Arabic? But there’s quite an interesting story behind this.
\n\nSometime in the year 771, Arab merchants took some Indian scholars to Baghdad (the present capital of Iraq) to help teach them the new set of numbers. After learning the numbers, the Arabs translated the numbers into their own script that is Arabic. Sometime later, the Arab traders carried a book of these numerals (in their language or script) to Europe, where the numbers were translated into Latin. As the world at large got these numbers from Arabia, these came to be known as Arabic.
\n\nIn fact, it is interesting to note that there is another number system in use. This is the ‘Roman’ numerical system. The numbers in this system are written as I, II, III, IV, V etc. Although this number system is also a well-developed one, there’s one problem in it. Since there is no symbol for zero in it, there is difficulty in carrying out addition, subtraction and other calculations.
\n\nLet’s take an example. In the Arabic number system the calculation of 2076+600, can be easily computed by arranging the numbers in two vertical columns;
\n\nHowever, the same calculation is not so easy, when it comes to the Roman system. Why? Because under the Roman system the numbers are written differently. This is because M means a thousand, D stands for 500, C stands for a hundred, L for fifty, X for ten, V for five and I for one.
\n\nIt is amazing what a big difference the seemingly simple and valueless number ‘0’ can make. The small number ‘1’ can be turned into a million! a billion!! Or even a trillion!!! – Thanks to the magical powers of zero.
\n\nHere are some more interesting facts. The script of the Arabic language (not mathematical) moves from right to left, unlike English, which moves from left to right. However, Arabic numbers are written from left to right. Why? Because they were borrowed from India!
\n\nSince the time they were invented, Arabic numerals have undergone only minor changes from the original Hindu manuscript. The numbers that have undergone slight changes include 4, 5, 6 and 7.
\n\nSo that is the “number story” – how numbers were born in India, travelled to Arabia and then to Europe. And now? Well, the whole world is using them all the time. Rather interesting, no?

        <item>As day breaks, a reddish-white ball of light that we call the sun, rises. This red haze gives way to a golden-white sheen as the day advances and reappears when the sun sets in the evening. Does the sun really change colours, or does it only seem so? The explanation lies in-between.
\n\nLight from the sun consists of three kinds of radiation – ultra-violet rays, visible light and infra-red rays. Unlike visible light, ultra-violet rays and infra-red rays cannot be seen.
\n\nThe visible light’s rays are white and consist of seven colours – violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red (known simply as VIBGYOR).
\n\nThe earth’s dust, gas and air particles scatter the sun’s light in different directions. Violet light has a peculiar property due to which it gets scattered the most. Red light gets scattered the least.
\n\nThe rising and setting sun
\n\nAt sunrise the earth is rotating towards the sun. Similarly, during sunset, the earth is rotating away from the sun. During these times the sunlight has to travel at an angle and thus cover a longer distance through the atmosphere. It encounters more obstacles in its path. Most of the colours, like green and violet, get scattered before the light reaches the earth. Since red is scattered the least, it is this colour that we see as it reaches us.
\n\nDuring noontime, the sun is directly overhead and it appears white. This is because the sunlight has to cover a much lesser distance through the atmosphere and it faces less obstacles. Hence, it escapes a great deal of scattering.
\n\nIn fact, if we were to calculate the distance the sun’s rays have to travel through the denser part of the atmosphere (roughly around 150 kms) to any point on earth, we would find that this journey of the rays is almost 50 times more at sunrise and sunset than at noon.
</item>
        <item>There are some things in nature that have a great capacity to toss back or reflect a great deal of the sun’s light that falls on them. One of them is snow. Newly formed snow reflects about 90 per cent of the sunlight that falls upon it. This means that the sun is powerless to melt clean snow. And when snow does melt, it is not because of the sunlight. Snow does not melt on a spring day because of the sun’s heat. It melts because of the warm air from the sea.
\n\nAfter snow becomes ice, a different problem arises. Clean ice absorbs about two-thirds of the sunlight that hits it – but ice is transparent enough for the light to penetrate quite a long way (10 metres or more) before the absorption takes place.
\n\nIt is remarkable what profound results follow from this simple property of transparency to sunlight. If, instead of penetrating deeply, the light were absorbed in a shallow surface layer of ice, the summer sun would quickly raise the temperature of the thin surface layer to melting point. And almost immediately, the water would run off.
\n\nBut when the sunlight penetrates a thick layer of ice before it can be absorbed, it cannot raise the temperature of the ice to melting point quickly enough. When the ice is very cold, the whole summer passes before any melting occurs at all. This is what happens today in the Antarctic, just as it must have happened in northern Europe during an Ice Age.
\n\nJust imagine, if by magic, ice were suddenly made opaque to light, the glaciers that exist today would melt away in a few years, raising the sea level by 60 metres or more. It would flood at least half the world’s population.
\n\nSimply amazing how so much depends on so simple a physical property!
\n\nClouds toss back about 50 per cent of the light that hits them. Ice and deserts reflect 35 per cent. Land areas are generally a good deal lower in reflectivity – usually 10 to 20 per cent, depending on the nature of vegetation.
\n\nOceans, which cover 71 per cent of the Earth’s surface, are least reflective of all – only about three per cent. That is why oceans appear dark in pictures of the Earth taken from the Moon or from artificial satellites.
\n\nWhen all the sources of reflection are added together, our planet is found to turn back into space some 36 per cent of the solar radiation falling upon it.

        <item>Till now we have only seen roads, railway stations, airports, places etc. being named after famous people. But imagine paying money to get a star named after you. If that can happen, then anything is possible in this world!
\n\nWell, there are organisations in different parts of the world that sell names for the stars in the sky. All you have to do is – go there, fill out the long, detailed form that they give you and buy star names or name stars after someone.
\n\nHowever, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in France disapproves of this. It says that this practice is neither valid nor ethical. The IAU also dislikes these companies “selling” fictitious star names or “real estate” on other planets or moons in the Solar System. It says that though some stars have traditional Arabic names, most other stars have just catalogue numbers and positions on the sky.
\n\nIAU explains that naming small groups of well-known bodies, like the planets or stars that can be seen by the naked eye, is fine. But there are hundreds of millions of stars. How can all be named? If they were all named, then finding any one star would be like trying to find Bank Street in India or Queen’s Road in Britain. Can you imagine doing that without a proper pin code number?
\n\nSimilarly for stars, having a particular pin code number, instead of a name, would help in locating them.
\n\nIt’s true that ‘gifting a star’ would be a unique present and would please anybody on this earth. But it is also true that the stars in the sky are for all of us to enjoy, and so they should not be for sale.
\n\nSo if you have a passion for the stars and the sky, then go to a planetarium and enjoy the beauty. Better still, lie down on your terrace and gaze at the starry sky. It sure is more pleasurable than spending huge sums of money just to get some fictitious star named after you.

        <item>The sun is a star, just like the thousands of others we see in the sky each night. But it looks so very big. Is it the biggest star? No. The only reason the sun appears so big is because it is closer to us than any other star.
\n\nThe sun is just 93,000,000 miles (or 14,88,000,000 km) away from the earth. That seems an awful lot of distance, but light can travel so quickly that the sun’s rays reach the earth in a little more than eight minutes! That is the wonder of light. \n\nMany of the stars that we see at night, are more than 1000 times farther away than the sun. Obviously, this means that their light, too, would take 1000 times more time to reach the earth. And most stars are so far away that their light takes hundreds or even thousands of years to reach us. \n\nThe distance travelled by light in a year, is called a light year (for those who have a head for figures, one light year is 58,780,000,000,000,000 miles). \n\nTherefore, if light takes 100 years to travel from a star to the earth, we say that the star is 100 light years away (100 x 58,780,000,000,000,000 miles.)
\n\nSome of the stars we can see in the night sky are so far away that it takes thousands and thousands of years for their light to reach us.
\n\nScientists have only been able to see some nearby stars. One of them is Alpha Centauri, which is 4.35 light years away.
\n\nYet another star, Alpha Canis Majoris, or Dog Star, which is the brightest star in the sky, is 8.48 light years away.
\n\nA look into the heavens or a plunge into the past
\n\nHere is something interesting to think about. If it takes 8.48 years for us to see the Dog Star, then doesn’t it mean that we are looking at it the way it looked 8.48 years ago? So, in that sense, aren’t we looking back into history?
\n\nBy this logic, if the Dog Star were to die today, when would we come to know about it? Only 8.48 years later, as we humans would continue to see the star till then.
\n\nThe deeper we look into the universe, the farther away we go both in time and space. And that is why scientists believe that if they could see the centre of the universe, then they would actually be able to see the events that led to the creation of the universe.
\n\nSo the next time you watch a movie by the name of Back to the future, you would surely know time travel is as simple as a peep into the night sky!

        <item>The elephant is the largest land animal. The Blue whale is the largest sea animal. But however big these animals may be, they can not size up to the colonies built by tiny little sea creatures – the coral. The colonies built by corals are called coral reefs. Coral reefs can be as huge as big islands or even as big as a country!
\n\nThese reef-building corals are not single animals. A coral is a colony made up of many individual animals called polyps. These are connected to each other.
\n\nA polyp has a hollow, cylindrical structure. It is attached with its lower end to some surface like a rock or the shallow seabed. At the free end is a mouth that is surrounded by tentacles. The tentacles are used to gather food. They are armed with specialised stinging structures, called nematocysts.
\n\nPolyp: the colony builder
\n\nWhen a polyp dies, it leaves behind its skeleton, which is made of a form of calcium carbonate called aragonite. The skeletons are the bricks by which coral reefs are built.
\n\nOver thousands of years, corals keep depositing their skeletons and newer corals thrive among the skeletons of their predecessors. These in turn form massive colonies, which combine to form a reef.
\n\nThe Great Barrier reef to the north of Australia is probably the most famous of them all. Remarkably, it is the only living organism that can be seen from outer space.
\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef is one of the planet’s 552 world heritage areas. It is larger than the United Kingdom and longer than the western coast of the United States of America.
\n\nBecause the reef is formed in shallow water, a large amount of sunlight penetrates through it. This is why it is a haven for other sea creatures.
\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef contains at least 1500 species of fish, 350 types of coral and 4000 varieties of molluscs. New species are being discovered every year. Six of the world’s seven species of marine turtle live in the Barrier Reef.
\n\nHowever, the reef is in danger today. Partly due to the rise in sea temperature and the subsequent rise in sea levels, and partially because of pollution and fishing activities in the region.

        <item>You’ve been playing in the pool for almost an hour now, practicing your best underwater somersaults. Now it’s time to get out, and as you look at your hands, it’s . . . it’s . . . it’s the attack of the wrinkly fingered monster!
\n\nDon’t get frightened or run for cover under your towel yet. After spending lots of time in the water, it’s totally normal for fingers (and sometimes toes) to wrinkle.
\n\nEven though you can’t see it, your skin is covered with its own special oil called sebum. Sebum is found on the outermost layer of skin. Sebum lubricates and protects your skin. It also makes your skin a bit waterproof. That’s why getting caught in the rain, hopping in the shower after a game, or washing your hands before dinner won’t leave your skin soggy. Sebum is there to keep the water out.
\n\nBut what happens when you spend a long time in the water? Well, there’s only a particular amount of sebum on your skin at a time. Once the sebum is washed away, the water can make its way into the outer layer of skin. The water does this by osmosis. This is when water actually moves from one thing into another, from a place where there is more water to a place where there is less water. There is more water in the pool than there is in your body, so it naturally moves to the place where there is less water – you!
\n\nAlthough your fingers may look shriveled like raisins, they aren’t really shriveled – they’re actually waterlogged! The extra water in your fingers causes the skin to swell in some places but not others, and that’s what causes the wrinkles.
\n\nIt isn’t just pool water that washes away the sebum. Sitting in the bathtub for a long soak can also wash away the sebum and leave a kid with soggy skin. Washing dishes for a long time, scrubbing and rinsing your puppy, cleaning the gravel in your aquarium – anything that keeps your hands in water long enough will give you wrinkly fingers.
\n\nWhat should you do if you come out of the pool looking like a raisin? Not a thing! Having wrinkly skin after a swim or bath doesn’t mean there is anything wrong, and it goes away by itself quickly. You’ll have more sebum on your skin in no time. If you really can’t stand the raisin look and will be doing something around the house that keeps your hands in water, you can wear rubber gloves to keep the sebum from being washed away.

        <item>All the food we eat goes into our stomach. Here, it is broken into smaller and simpler substances and get absorbed into the blood. Then, the blood carries these food particles to the different cells of the body, where they are used to provide energy to our body.
\n\nHow is food broken into smaller particles?
\n\nWhen we eat, the glands lining the walls of the stomach secrete a thin, strongly acidic, almost colorless liquid, called gastric juice. It contains two kinds of enzymes called pepsin and rennin that break down the food to simpler substances. These enzymes can function only in a highly acidic environment.
\n\nThat is why the gastric juices contain a very strong acid called hydrochloric acid. It is a colourless, or, faintly yellow, corrosive, and fuming liquid. The acid is so strong that it can corrode metal and burn almost anything that touches it.
\n\nThough all humans carry this strong acid in their stomachs, surprisingly it does not harm them. This is because of the presence of a slimy, white liquid that flows out our noses. It is called mucus.
\n\nIt is a viscous mixture of mucins, water, electrolytes, epithelial cells, that form the inner lining of the skin, and leukocytes, which are white blood cells that fight disease. It is secreted by glands present on the surface of our nose and stomach.
\n\nMucins are glycoproteins which make any substance viscous and act as a lubricant.
\n\nThe mucus secreted by different parts of our bodies have special functions. In our nose, it serves as a lubricator and stops dirt and dust from going deep into the nose and also aids breathing. In our stomach, it forms a layer between the deadly gastric juices and the lining of the stomach walls. This mucus lining prevents the acid present in the gastric juices from damaging the stomach.
\n\nThis wall created by the mucus layer is called the mucus membrane. It behaves like an acid-proof glove that the stomach uses to save itself from getting burnt while using harmful acids.

        <item>My mother took out her favourite blue silk saree for the dinner party. I looked at it, mesmerised by its shimmer and lustre. The rich fabric draped around her body, making her look so very elegant. Definitely no other fabric can match the qualities of silk.
\n\nBut have you ever wondered, how silk fabric came into existence? Silk production, or ‘Sericulture’ as it is known, has a long history, unknown to most of us.
\n\nThe silken roots
\n\nThe history of silk is shrouded in mystery. Some historians say that silk originated in China about 10,000 years ago. In China, however, legend has it that Empress Si Ling Chi of China was the first one to discover silk more than five thousand years ago. The story goes that while sitting under a mulberry tree in her palace garden, the Empress was having tea. A cocoon fell into her hot cup of tea from the branches of the mulberry tree. And as she watched, a strong white thread unraveled itself.
\n\nThat accidental process of unravelling the silkworm’s cocoon hasn’t changed much in the last thousands of years. Cocoons are still dipped in hot water to loosen the tightly woven filaments that make up a silkworm’s cocoon. These filaments, or fine threads, are unwound onto a spool. Each cocoon is made up of a filament between 600 and 900 meters long! Imagine that! You could take just one tiny cocoon and when you unravel its filament, you could wind it around your house more than eight times. Of course, these filaments are very very thin. Between five and eight of these super-fine filaments are twisted together to make one silk thread.
\n\nBy the 14th century BC, the production of silk gradually developed into an industry in China. In fact it became one of the principal elements of the Chinese economy. Silk was being used for musical instruments, fishing-lines, bowstrings, and even rag paper, the world’s first luxury paper.
\n\n
\n\nFor more than two thousand years, the Chinese kept the secret of silk to themselves. It was one of the most zealously guarded secrets in history. Anyone found guilty of smuggling silkworm eggs, cocoons, or mulberry seeds was put to death. Silk became the cloth of emperors and royalty and a great source of wealth. Within the palace, the emperor used to adorn a robe of white silk while outside, he, his principal wife, and the heir to the throne wore yellow, the color of the earth.
\n\nCommon people were prohibited from wearing silk. Even the merchants trading silk were allowed to wear the exclusive fabric. Silk was stocked in warehouses for an emergency.
\n\nThe Chinese used silk in many ways. Civil servants were paid in quantities of silk, and it was a way for the rulers to reward their subjects. Silk was also used as currency in domestic as well as foreign trade. After all, barter trade was the most common way of trading. So Chinese traders exchanged their silk in return for spices and jewels bought in India.
\n\nGradually, people from different sections of society began wearing tunics of silk, and silk came into more general use.
\n\nLetting the secret out of the silky bag
\n\nIn 200 BC, that’s about 2200 years ago, a large number of people migrated from China and settled in Korea. They carried with them the secret of silk production. From then on, the secret of silk slowly travelled throughout Asia. It took about five hundred years for the knowledge of silk production to reach India. But once it did, India soon started trading silk with the Persians. However, in less than a hundred years, the Persians, too, had mastered the art of silk weaving, and started developing their own rich patterns and techniques.
\n\nIt was only as late as the 13th century AD, that Italy began silk production, with the introduction of 2000 skilled silk weavers from Persia. That’s only about 700 years ago, which isn’t very long considering that silk came to India one thousand years before that.
\n\nEventually, silk production became widespread in Europe, but the widespread production of silk hasn’t dented China’s image as the Silk Giant. Even today, five thousand years after the first cocoon fell into the Empress’ teacup, China is still the world’s largest producer of silk.
